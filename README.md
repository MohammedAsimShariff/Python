# Rainfall Analysis in Python

The Rainfall Analysis project in Python provides valuable insights into rainfall patterns, trends, and variability over time in India.
This project aims to find several key factors like wettest and driest places, rainfall distribution by month, annual rainfall across states, top 5 districts with heavy and low rainfall, number of districts in each state and many more.

Key Insights:

* Tamenglong is a wettest ditrict with a highest annual rainfall of 7229.3mm.

* Ladakh (Leh) is a driest district with a lowest annual rainfall of 94.6mm.

* The most rainfall happens in the month of july across the India.

* The least rainfall happens in the month of december across the India.

* I have analysed the above data to find the other insights like annual rainfall across states, top 5 districts with highest and lowest rainfall and no of districts in each states.

* Created some visuals to see the insights thrugh visualizations.
